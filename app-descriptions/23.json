{"package_name":"com.alexisblaze.japanese_grammar","title":"Learning Japanese","description":"Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese now available in Google Play! IMPORTANT :\nThe latest update is a bug fix for tablet layout being wrongly used in phone and crashing when navigating. Those who have update to version 0.3.1 and are having the problem, please update. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. \n\nTopics covered include: \n\n- The Japanese Writing System (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji)\n- Basic Japanese Grammar (Particles, Adjective, Verbs, Nouns)\n- Essential Japanese Grammar (Polite Forms, Compound, Conditionals, etc.)\n- Special Expressions (Causative, Amounts, Honorific, etc.)\n- Advanced Topics (Formal Expressions, Volitional, etc.)\n\nThis guide was created as a resource for those who want to learn Japanese grammar in a rational, intuitive way that makes sense in Japanese. The explanations are focused on how to make sense of the grammar not from English but from a Japanese point of view.\n\nThis guide is an attempt to systematically build up the grammatical structures that make up the Japanese language in a way that makes sense in Japanese. It may not be a practical tool for quickly learning immediately usable phrases such as for travel. However, it will logically create successive building blocks that will result in a solid grammatical foundation. For those of you who have learned Japanese from textbooks, you may see some big differences in how the material is ordered and presented. This is because this guide does not seek to forcibly create artificial ties between English and Japanese by presenting the material in a way that makes sense in English. Instead, examples with translations will show how ideas are expressed in Japanese resulting in simpler explanations that are easier to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","short_desc":"","rating":4.3043394088745,"category":"Education","cat_int":6,"cat_type":0,"cat_key":"EDUCATION","cat_keys":["EDUCATION","APPLICATION"],"price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":false,"iap_min":0,"iap_max":0,"size":11534336,"downloads":"100,000 - 500,000","downloads_min":100000,"downloads_max":500000,"version":"0.3.1.3","content_rating":"Unrated","what_is_new":"Added by popular request :\n- the app will remember opened page history, pressing back will navigate this history in reverse chronological order, pressing back when the history is empty will still close the app.\n- in tablet : the width of the navigation is resizeable by dragging the dividing line between navigation & content, tapping on it will toggle between fully hiding it & resetting it to the recommended width (note : phone will still use the navigation drawer)\n- don't show the +- zoom button\n","market_update":"2014-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","screenshots":["https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/wagmzmYqm5vTPvUu1sDrJP5d-09DIS0WCOiXDlYtwUg6fb7UxeVSqcv0yuwGh-Lc0jAV=h310","https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/YaF_A55eSSkXH-Sy0NPJcVk9-TGOdzqy0wCHL84WR95ukhZOnkShcJj2o6AsUhIEXYId=h310","https:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/KUAoXampADFun2ED99jNq9_812ewN2QsnYQlIumTf_XvIFJjbW9J1Lrni5ohQVF_sJo=h310","https:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/H4hhbflfaQ7kjfC6A59ic0Itdpfj2g9chKorHFgZlwKjrG-3veGwmzxVbfVaTbe1ABQ=h310","https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/r9Col6tANzboylA3_moi_xsX0NSrZGfFgx2lh9fitxl1OaDMWrxO8YPcMwAD02z_fA=h310","https:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/KsZ8d4a9U6HXgEVzOekJ5piU1T360y3R3lnnK65C2yNt5VbOMf11Cr27B_XpigE0CVE=h310"],"lang":"en","i18n_lang":["en"],"price_i18n_countries":[],"website":"http:\/\/www.erauqssidlroweht.com\/","from_developer":[],"created":"2013-12-06T03:04:19+00:00","version_code":8,"developer":"Ignatius Reza","number_ratings":5231,"icon":"https:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/kJ_WVVN4JtDd762m99BZHTt9cCA6acTiv-gKuCX0j3kkoeV7vcoVsEGc3ND_rG6Xh1c=w300","icon_72":"https:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/kJ_WVVN4JtDd762m99BZHTt9cCA6acTiv-gKuCX0j3kkoeV7vcoVsEGc3ND_rG6Xh1c=w72","promo_video":"","market_url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.alexisblaze.japanese_grammar&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi","deep_link":"http:\/\/playboard.me\/android\/apps\/com.alexisblaze.japanese_grammar"}
