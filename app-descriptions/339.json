And there are many different ways to it : sprinting, crossfit, running, bodyweight workouts, cycling, yoga, stretching, weightlifting, boxing ... \n\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an enhanced form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating periods of short intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 4\u201330 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition, improved glucose metabolism, and improved fat burning.\nThis definition comes from wikipedia (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/High-intensity_interval_training) where you can find a lot more informations. It explains some very popular program, like the TABATA. HIIT is also a common practice in Crossfit trainings.\n\n\n* HOW TO USE THE APP ? *\nYou can use it during all trainings with intervals or other timed repetition \n\nBasically, this is how it works : on the first screen you will set up your workout phases durations (preparation time, work, rest, rounds and cool down) and you will choose your sound.\nThen hit \u201cGo !\u201d, work and just follow the sound\u2026 or the voice !\nYou can listen to your own music, just make sure you can still hear the sound.\nAt the end of the workout, a new feature allows you to share your workout with your friends on Facebook and Twitter @hiit_android \n\n\n* PHONE PERMISSIONS *\nNow automatically pause and resume if a phone call arrives.\nThis is why PHONE_STATE permissions are required. But the app never collects and stores phone numbers from users phones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","short_desc":"Focus on your workout, no distractions, just follow the sound !","rating":4.2966470718384,"category":"Health & Fitness","cat_int":9,"cat_type":0,"cat_key":"HEALTH_AND_FITNESS","cat_keys":["HEALTH_AND_FITNESS","APPLICATION"],"price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":true,"iap_min":0,"iap_max":0,"downloads":"1,000,000 - 5,000,000","downloads_min":1000000,"downloads_max":5000000,"version":"Varies with device","content_rating":"Everyone","what_is_new":"1\/ Ad remover now available through in-app purchase for $1.49 It\u2019s so easy to get rid of every ads !\n2\/ In-App Survey button at the bottom of the screen : tell us what new features you\u2019d like to get in the app, take a few minutes to answer our short survey, thank you !
