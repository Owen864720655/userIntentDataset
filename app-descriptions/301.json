{"package_name":"com.motorola.contextual.smartrules2","title":"Motorola Assist","description":"Motorola Assist recognizes when it\u2019s important to get the notifications you need. It knows when you\u2019re driving and automatically reads out new text messages or plays music. When you\u2019re at home it announces your incoming calls. Motorola Assist even recognizes when you shouldn\u2019t be bothered, like when you\u2019re sleeping or in a meeting. You can set actions and exceptions so that they work exactly how you want them to. Some features may not be available in your device.","short_desc":"Motorola Assist automates your phone to make your life simpler","rating":4.1033711433411,"category":"Tools","cat_int":21,"cat_type":0,"cat_key":"TOOLS","cat_keys":["TOOLS","APPLICATION"],"price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":false,"iap_min":0,"iap_max":0,"downloads":"50,000,000 - 100,000,000","downloads_min":50000000,"downloads_max":100000000,"version":"Varies with device","content_rating":"Everyone","what_is_new":"For devices running Android Marshmallow, the Sleeping and Meeting features have been removed from Motorola Assist because those settings are now available in Android.
