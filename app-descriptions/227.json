{"package_name":"com.snrblabs.grooveip","title":"GrooVe IP VoIP Calls & Text","description":"Turn your Android device into a free phone. Get a free US phone number that will be able to receive calls and texts from anywhere in the world. In addition, you will be able to call and text real US and Canadian phone numbers using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology. GrooVe IP works on any android device, mobile phone or tablet, and allows you to make calls using the device\u2019s data (WiFi or mobile data) connection. If you have a smart-phone with Wi-Fi connectivity but no mobile plan, you can use this app to convert it to a free, full-featured working phone. If you are travelling overseas, you can take your device with you and make\/receive calls for free on WiFi without paying any carrier roaming charges. You get all of this without using any of your cellular minutes. \n\nWith our new service, you can call or text other GrooVe IP users without any cost, no matter where they are. All incoming calls and texts are also free, no matter which country the caller is in. You can also call or text other numbers in the US and Canada by using free credits given to you each month. If you run out of free credits, you can earn more by watching videos or completing offers, or purchase credits using a Paypal account or credit card. You can also use earned\/purchased credits to make\/receive calls using standard SIP clients (soft-phones on PC\/Mac\/Linux, or standalone SIP phones) using SIP credentials provided by us. \n\nGrooVe IP has a separate dialer that can be used to make calls. Alternatively, the native dialer, call-log, contacts, and favorite functionality can be shared between the phone and GrooVe IP on a call-by-call basis. Upgrade to the Pro (ad-free) version of GrooVe IP (https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.gvoip) to remove ads.\n\nFor requirements, setup details, answers to frequently asked questions, known issues, or more information, please visit https:\/\/snrblabs.com\/GrooVeIp\/Index\n\nIf you have any questions, feature requests, or run into any problems please contact us!
